**Welcome to the official Capture the Flag Club Discord!**
We are Capture the Flag Club, a University of Adelaide club that competes in Capture the Flag competitions (CTFs) and other hacking events! To explain, a CTF is a competition that typically runs for 1-2 days, wherein teams attempt to apply their knowledge of cyber security to solve challenges. These challenges contain hidden flags - short pieces of text which teams must find and submit to gain points and climb the leaderboard. The team that accumulates the most number of points during the event wins the CTF, and potentially some cool prizes too! For example, these challenges may require you to break a poorly implemented RSA cipher, or find input into a program that unintentionally gives you control of the computer remotely. There's no prior knowledge required to participate. In fact, we plan to host talks and social events of our own so you can learn more about cyber security! For more information, and how to join, please check out our new website at https://adelaideb9.com/. Finally, check out our CTFtime team, titled AdelaideB9, at https://ctftime.org/team/147168 - this is where you can see our best (and worst) previous CTF performance.

**Updates and Social Media**
Announcements made on Discord will always be made in the <#828952837463080990> channel, with events also being posted in the <#803243007398510674> channel - where you can express interest in different events. Expressing interest in events really helps us predict the turnout. Furthermore, while we try and keep Discord as up to date and active as possible, you should also check out our LinkedIn (https://linkedin.com/company/adelaideb9/) and Facebook (https://facebook.com/adelaideb9).

**Rules**
As with most Discord servers, this server, and associated club, has rules that all members must abide by. These rules are:

1) No spamming 
2) Be respectful of each other's differences
3) No attacking the infrastructure of our own servers or others - unless you have explicit permission to do so from the owner.
4) Keep everything Safe for Work
5) Respect the rules of the CTFs you participate in
6) The security field isn't always black and white in what's right or wrong. To avoid harm to the wider team, individuals are not allowed to carry out actions in the club's/team's name unless otherwise decided upon by the club's committee 

**Registration**
Before you can access the rest of the server, you will need to sign up for a club membership - by which you are agreeing to our constitution at https://adelaideb9.com/constitution. To become a member just visit https://adelaideb9.com/register and complete the form. Once registered, you'll be able to use our member platform and gain full access to this Discord server just by linking your account. This process is required as it helps avoid any potential conflicts - such as flag sharing, or a breach or rules - and serves to keep our members safe. If you're having any issues registering or general questions, shoot us an email at hello@adelaideb9.com or DM a <@&938276023387181066> member and we'll be in touch as quickly as possible.
