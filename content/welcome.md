**Welcome to AdelaideB9!**

We are an Adelaide Uni based CTF team actively participating in CTFS and other hacking events. We have a number of public resources, all of which can be found from our website at https://www.adelaideb9.com/. If you're in South Australia and are not a University of Adelaide student,  fear not. After reading the rules below, just email us at hello@adelaideb9.com or DM @ðŸ”¨  asking for permission to join and we'll be in contact. For everyone else, please read the rules below and authenticate yourself by messaging the bot with ./auth.

**Rules**

As with most discord servers, this server, and associated club, has rules that all members must abide by. These rules are:
1) No spamming 
2) Be respectful of differences
3) No attacking the infrastructure
4) Keep everything SFW
5) The security field isn't always black and white in what's right or wrong. To avoid harm to the wider team, individuals are not allowed to carry out actions in the club's/team's name unless otherwise decided upon by the club's committee
